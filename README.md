# Machine-Learning-in-Weather-Forecasting-A-Comparative-Approach-with-Emphasis-on-Neural-Networks-

# Problem Statement:
Weather forecasting is crucial for various industries and daily life activities, as it enables better decision-making and preparedness in response to changing weather conditions. However, traditional methods of weather forecasting may not always be accurate or reliable. This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging machine learning and neural network models to develop a more accurate and reliable weather prediction system.

# Abstract:
This project aims to enhance weather forecasting through the integration of machine learning and neural networks, leveraging the strengths of both methodologies. By evaluating eight machine learning models and three neural network models on a dataset comprising 12 columns and 96453 entries, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed features, the project seeks to identify the most effective approach for weather prediction. The project underscores the effectiveness of machine learning models in handling large datasets and making precise predictions, while highlighting the capability of deep learning models, particularly LSTM, in extracting nuanced features from weather data. Ultimately, this research endeavors to contribute to more accurate and informed decision-making in response to dynamic atmospheric conditions.
